0. Pre-procesessing or Data Cleaning & EDA

1. Feature Extraction (only when data is unstructured (text, image) )
text: CV, TF-IDF, Embeddings etc..
images: Pixels, OR (HOG, SURF, SIFT, Gabor Features etc...)

2. Feature Engineering:  Generate new meaningful features using existing features.

3. Feature Selection: FFS, BFS, RFE, SelectKBest, F Imp. from RF/ET, Lasso, etc...
Dimensionality Reduction:.. PCA, TuncatedSVD - alternative to Feature Selection

4. Feature Transformation (most tricky): make sure you are doing the "right" transformation for each datatype (numeric/nominal/ordinal)
- This MUST be the LAST step of data transformation, before ML model is trained!

================

which would be the best score for a model - accuracy, recall, f1 score ?

Classes >>> 0/ 1
TP (1 pred as 1) , TN (0 pred as 0)  >> correct predictions

incorrect predictions >>> FP (0 is being predicted as 1)  vs FN (1 is being predicted as 0 by the model)
 
If you are non-biased (equally "concerned") about the 2 classes >>> then overall accuracy is sufficient

whereas if your are more "concerned" when FP is more OR FN is more...
OR if there is HUGE class imbalance!

e.g. Face recog s/w or app in you mobile phone... phone unlock using/recognizing your face...
1: Prashant,... 0: not Prashant
FP >> Other person is recognized as Prashant
FN >> Prashant's face is not being recognized

==================================
Another example (COVID)
1: Covid +ve
0: Covid -ve
FP: Covid -ve patient being marked as +ve (0 marked as 1)
FN: Covid +ve patient being marked as -ve (1 marked as 0)

Precision, Recall & F1-score are defined for each class.
    	 PRed Class
	0	1
Actual 0:  200	20
Actual 1: 30	300

TP:  300   	FP: 20
TN:  200	FN: 30

Precision: Out of total PREDICTIONS (for a given class), how many were correct.
Precision for Class Y=1:   (300) / (300 + 20)
Precision for Class Y=0:   (200) / (200+30)

Recall: Out of total ACTUALS (for a given class), how many were predicted correct (how many instances of that class the model was able to "recollect")
Recall for Class Y=1:   (300) / (300 + 30)
Recall for Class Y=0:   (200) / (200+ 20)

If ALL the 550 passengers are marked as COVID Positive: Recall = 100%    >>>> Precion for class Y=1 =>     330 / 550  ~ 60%
F1-Score:  Harmonic mean of Pr & Rec

F1-Score:  2*Pr*Rec/(Pr + Rec)  ==> 1.2/1.6 = 3/4 = 0.75    
F1-score: tradeoff betwen the model's precision & recall 
Ideally, we want a model with the higher F1-score!
